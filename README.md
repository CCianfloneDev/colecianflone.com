# Cole Cianflone's Portfolio 👋

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio site built with React and TypeScript. I built it to be blazing-fast and completely free to host (because who likes monthly bills?). It's got server-side rendering, a blog system, and hits perfect Lighthouse scores.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Pop open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CCianfloneDev/colecianflone.com.git
cd colecianflone.com
npm install
npm run dev
```

Head over to `http://localhost:5173` and you should see everything up and running!

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- React + TypeScript for the good stuff
- React Router for smooth navigation
- TailwindCSS because styling should be fun
- Markdown for easy blogging
- Server-side rendering for speed

## 🌐 Putting It Online

You've got options! While this project is set up for Cloudflare Workers (because free is awesome), you can host it pretty much anywhere.

### Option A: The Free Way (Cloudflare Workers)

1. Grab a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (free tier is perfect)
2. Set up Wrangler:

   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   npx wrangler login
   ```

3. Ship it:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run deploy
   ```

### Option B: Your Way

Feel free to deploy to wherever you're comfortable with:

- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Or anywhere else that can host a React app!
