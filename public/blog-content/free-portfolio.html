<h1 id="how-i-built-my-portfolio-site-for-0">How I Built My Portfolio Site for $0</h1><p>When I started planning my portfolio site, I hit the same wall every developer faces: those &quot;reasonable&quot; monthly costs that add up fast. Shared hosting, VPS providers, static site hosts—they all follow the same pattern. What starts as $5-15 a month becomes hundreds of dollars over a few years, and that&#39;s before you factor in SSL certificates, CDN services, and performance upgrades.</p><p>For a personal portfolio that might get a few hundred visitors monthly, those recurring costs felt like overkill. I wanted something professional and fast, but I also wanted to see if I could build it without bleeding money every month.</p><p>Then I discovered Cloudflare Workers and realized I could build something genuinely professional without any monthly bills. Here&#39;s exactly how I did it—and how you can too.</p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#why-free-made-sense">Why Free Made Sense</a></li><li><a href="#the-cloudflare-workers-discovery">The Cloudflare Workers Discovery</a></li><li><a href="#what-youll-actually-build">What You&#39;ll Actually Build</a></li><li><a href="#performance-and-seo-optimization">Performance and SEO Optimization</a></li><li><a href="#complete-setup-guide">Complete Setup Guide</a><ul><li><a href="#prerequisites">Prerequisites</a></li><li><a href="#installation">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#running-the-project">Running the Project</a></li><li><a href="#project-structure">Project Structure</a></li><li><a href="#writing-blog-posts">Writing Blog Posts</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#technology-stack-breakdown">Technology Stack Breakdown</a></li><li><a href="#deploying-to-cloudflare-workers">Deploying to Cloudflare Workers</a></li><li><a href="#configuration-files">Configuration Files</a></li><li><a href="#final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</a></li></ul><h2 id="why-free-made-sense">Why Free Made Sense</h2><p>My requirements were straightforward: professional appearance, fast loading, and blog capability. But every option I researched had the same problem—costs that seemed reasonable at first but would compound into serious money over time.</p><p>Traditional shared hosting felt sluggish and came with weird limitations. Static site generators were appealing, but most still required paid hosting for decent performance. Serverless platforms had free tiers, but they were either too restrictive or confusing to set up properly.</p><p>I needed something that was:</p><ul><li>Actually free (not &quot;free for 12 months&quot;)</li><li>Fast and reliable worldwide</li><li>Easy to maintain long-term</li><li>Professional looking</li><li>Capable of handling both static pages and a blog</li></ul><h2 id="the-cloudflare-workers-discovery">The Cloudflare Workers Discovery</h2><p>Cloudflare Workers initially seemed like enterprise-only territory, but their free tier is surprisingly generous:</p><ul><li>100,000 requests per day</li><li>Global edge network (fast loading everywhere)</li><li>Custom domains with free SSL certificates</li><li>No cold starts or server management</li><li>Built-in CDN</li></ul><p>The catch? There really isn&#39;t one for personal projects. The free tier limits are higher than most portfolio sites will ever hit.</p><p>Setting it up was more straightforward than expected once I figured out the right approach. Instead of trying to run a full server, I built a static site that gets served from their edge network worldwide.</p><h2 id="what-youll-actually-build">What You'll Actually Build</h2><p>After finishing this project, I realized I&#39;d created something that checks all the boxes for a modern developer portfolio:</p><p><strong>Developer Experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Modern development with hot reload</li><li>TypeScript for better code completion and error catching</li><li>Simple deployment that just works</li><li>Zero server management headaches</li></ul><p><strong>Visitor Experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Lightning-fast loading times</li><li>Seamless experience across all devices</li><li>Accessible to users with disabilities</li><li>Professional appearance that reflects well on your work</li></ul><p><strong>Financial Reality:</strong></p><ul><li>$0 monthly hosting costs</li><li>$0 build pipeline costs</li><li>$0 CDN costs</li><li>$0 SSL certificate costs</li><li>(Optional) $10-15 yearly for a custom domain</li></ul><h2 id="performance-and-seo-optimization">Performance and SEO Optimization</h2><p>Building this site became an unexpected journey into web performance and search optimization. Working within free service constraints pushed me toward solutions that were not only cost-effective but genuinely better.</p><h3 id="performance-deep-dive">Performance Deep Dive</h3><p><strong>Content Delivery Strategy</strong> Rather than relying on external services, I focused on static generation and smart caching. Pre-rendered HTML pages load instantly, all assets flow through Cloudflare&#39;s CDN, and responsive images adapt to different screen sizes automatically.</p><p><strong>Typography Approach</strong> Font loading can make or break perceived speed. Instead of Google Fonts (which requires external requests), I went with self-hosted Inter font files. This means font preloading for critical text, proper font-display strategies, and optimized WOFF2 format for smaller file sizes.</p><p><strong>User Interface</strong> I kept JavaScript minimal but added touches that make the site feel modern: subtle page transitions that don&#39;t get in the way, dark mode that respects system preferences.</p><p><strong>Build Process Automation</strong> The build system handles content generation automatically. Markdown files convert to optimized HTML, the blog index generates from frontmatter, CSS gets optimized with Tailwind&#39;s purging, and everything gets minified for deployment.</p><h3 id="built-in-seo-features">Built-in SEO Features</h3><p>These search optimization features work automatically without any configuration:</p><p><strong>Automatic Sitemap Generation</strong> Creates <code>sitemap.xml</code> with all pages and blog posts, updates automatically when you add content, and helps search engines discover everything.</p><p><strong>Rich Metadata</strong> Includes Open Graph tags for social media previews, Twitter Card support, proper canonical URLs and descriptions, and JSON-LD structured data for blog posts.</p><p><strong>Performance as SEO</strong> Search engines favor fast sites, and this setup delivers: pre-rendered HTML for instant loading, self-hosted Inter font with optimal loading strategy, font preloading for critical content, responsive images with proper sizing, minified assets, CDN delivery via Cloudflare&#39;s global network, minimal JavaScript required for hydration, and smooth page transitions.</p><p>The results exceeded expectations: excellent Lighthouse scores across all metrics, sub-second page loads globally, great mobile performance, and solid accessibility ratings—all factors that search engines love.</p><h2 id="complete-setup-guide">Complete Setup Guide</h2><p>Ready to build your own?

The code is open source and ready to use. You can clone the repository, customize the design, add your content, deploy to Cloudflare, and have a professional portfolio running in an afternoon.</p><p>Sometimes the best solutions come from working within constraints rather than throwing money at problems. Building something great doesn&#39;t always require a budget—sometimes it just needs curiosity and willingness to learn from limitations.</p><hr><p><em>Questions or suggestions?
