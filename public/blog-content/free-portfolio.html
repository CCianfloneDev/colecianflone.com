<h1 id="how-i-built-my-portfolio-site-for-0">How I Built My Portfolio Site for $0</h1><p>Like most developers, I wanted a portfolio site but but paying ongoing fees for a personal site that might get a handful of visitors felt unnecessary. There are lots of cheap options ($5-10 monthly), but still, why?? The costs add up quickly for something that isn&#39;t generating revenue.</p><p>I kept thinking there had to be a better way and started exploring different options. Initially, I looked into using a VPC thinking I could set up something more cost-effective than shared hosting, but honestly it&#39;s overkill for a simple portfolio site. While cloud providers have reasonable free tiers, I found myself drawn to Cloudflare Workers&#39; straightforward limit of 100,000 requests per day rather than trying to decode complex free tier restrictions and bandwidth calculations, or worry about hardening a server because I didn&#39;t want to pay for easy but more expensive shared hosting.</p><p>What I&#39;ll show you is how to build a portfolio site that costs nothing to run (no hosting fees, no monthly bills, nothing). The only optional cost is a custom domain, which you can purchase through Cloudflare for around $10-15 per year. You can skip that entirely and use their free subdomain if you prefer.</p><p>This approach also works well for testing side project ideas without committing to monthly bills upfront. If you end up with something that gets serious traffic (over 100,000 requests per day), you&#39;re probably ready to either upgrade to paid tiers or you&#39;ve built something worth investing in properly.</p><h2 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h2><p><strong>My Story &amp; Experience:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#why-this-matters-beyond-just-saving-money" title="Learn about the benefits beyond cost savings">Why This Matters (Beyond Just Saving Money)</a></li><li><a href="#my-experience-with-vpc-and-why-they-werent-right-for-me" title="Why I chose against VPC hosting solutions">My Experience with VPC (And Why They Weren&#39;t Right for Me)</a></li><li><a href="#the-aha-moment-with-cloudflare-workers" title="Discovering Cloudflare Workers&#39; generous free tier">The &quot;Aha&quot; Moment with Cloudflare Workers</a></li><li><a href="#what-i-actually-built" title="Overview of the final portfolio site features">What I Actually Built</a></li><li><a href="#performance-optimizations-that-made-a-difference" title="Key optimizations for speed and user experience">Performance Optimizations That Made a Difference</a></li><li><a href="#why-this-approach-works-for-saas-ideas" title="Using this setup for testing side project ideas">Why This Approach Works for SaaS Ideas</a></li><li><a href="#final-thoughts" title="Reflections on the entire process">Final Thoughts</a></li></ul><p><strong>Complete Technical Guide:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="#prerequisites" title="What you need installed before starting">Prerequisites</a></li><li><a href="#installation" title="Getting the code and dependencies set up">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#running-the-project" title="Starting local development server">Running the Project</a></li><li><a href="#project-structure" title="Understanding how the codebase is organized">Project Structure</a></li><li><a href="#writing-blog-posts" title="How to create and publish new blog content">Writing Blog Posts</a></li><li><a href="#technology-stack-breakdown" title="Detailed overview of all libraries and tools used">Technology Stack Breakdown</a></li><li><a href="#deploying-to-cloudflare-workers" title="Step-by-step deployment instructions">Deploying to Cloudflare Workers</a></li><li><a href="#configuration-files" title="Understanding the project configuration">Configuration Files</a></li></ul><h2 id="why-this-matters-beyond-just-saving-money">Why This Matters (Beyond Just Saving Money)</h2><p>Sure, avoiding monthly bills is nice, but there are other benefits that made this whole experiment worthwhile.</p><p>If you&#39;re working on side projects, starting with free infrastructure means you can actually test ideas without committing to ongoing costs before you even know if anyone cares about what you&#39;re building. This removes the financial barrier to experimentation.</p><p>Learning a new tool and way of deployment is always good, why not?</p><p>Once it&#39;s set up, there&#39;s practically nothing to maintain. No servers to update, no security patches to worry about, no monitoring dashboards.</p><p>My requirements were straightforward: look decent and professional, load fast, cost nothing to maintain, be easy to update when I actually write something, and handle blog posts without needing a database.</p><h2 id="my-experience-with-vpc-and-why-they-werent-right-for-me">My Experience with VPC (And Why They Weren't Right for Me)</h2><p>Before landing on Cloudflare Workers, I spent some time exploring VPC setups thinking they might be more cost-effective than traditional shared hosting solutions. On paper, it seemed like I could get more control over my infrastructure while potentially saving money.</p><p>I should mention that I&#39;m comfortable with VPC setups and have used them for other projects before. This wasn&#39;t about technical capability. After diving into the documentation and pricing for various cloud providers[^6] [^7], I realized VPC setups were probably overkill for what I needed. The free tiers looked generous on the surface with decent compute instances, storage, and CDN usage. But here&#39;s what made me hesitate.</p><p>Setting up VPC infrastructure, configuring security groups, managing instances, it was all just more work than I wanted to do and I didn&#39;t want to worry about it just to host a simple site. The free tiers have so many moving parts and conditions that I spent more time trying to understand billing scenarios and setting up alerts, than actually building anything.</p><p>While free tiers include bandwidth, I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that I might accidentally exceed limits or misconfigure something and get hit with surprise charges. Even with managed services, there&#39;s still updates, security considerations, and monitoring to think about.</p><p>What drew me to Cloudflare Workers was the simplicity. 100,000 requests per day felt like a number I could understand and feel comfortable with. With VPC hosting, I kept second-guessing whether my usage patterns would stay within free tier bounds or if some configuration mistake would cost me money.</p><p>For a personal portfolio that might get a few visitors per day, I wanted something I could set up once and forget about, something that wouldn&#39;t require me to become an infrastructure expert.</p><h2 id="the-aha-moment-with-cloudflare-workers">The "Aha" Moment with Cloudflare Workers</h2><p>It was like the goldie locks story, kinda? I knew that comitting to $5-10 monthly for shared hosting would be too expensive in the long run, but configuring a VPC was over-complicated for what I wanted. Cloudflare workers, were just right.</p><p>I actually first started with Cloudflare pages, which is more simple to setup but I was experiencing some issues with my blog and how CF pages serves content. CF workers also seemed cool because it supports SSR and full-stack applications. I gave it a shot after looking a their free tier limits, it was quite generous. According to Cloudflare&#39;s official documentation[^2], the free tier includes 100,000 requests per day, global edge network distribution, custom domains with free SSL, no servers to manage, and a built-in CDN.</p><p>For a personal portfolio that might get a few dozen visits a day, those limits are more than sufficient. Free to host, and I could sleep easy at night knowing I didn&#39;t have to worry about accidentally configuring my server and being hacked or whatever. Thats all I wanted.</p><h2 id="what-i-actually-built">What I Actually Built</h2><p>After going through this process, I ended up with something that covers the basics for a developer portfolio.</p><p>The development experience includes local development with hot reload, TypeScript for catching errors early, a simple deployment process, and zero server maintenance.</p><p>For visitors, the site offers fast loading times globally, works well on mobile devices, includes basic accessibility features, and has a clean, professional appearance.</p><p>Cost-wise, there are no monthly hosting costs, no build pipeline costs, no CDN costs, and no SSL certificate costs. The only optional expense is $10-15 yearly for a custom domain through Cloudflare, though you can stick with their free subdomain.</p><h2 id="performance-optimizations-that-made-a-difference">Performance Optimizations That Made a Difference</h2><p>Working within free tier constraints pushed me toward some solutions that actually worked quite well. I spent time optimizing especially for mobile users and people on slower connections.</p><p>Instead of relying on external services, everything gets pre-rendered and served from Cloudflare&#39;s edge network. HTML loads quickly, images are optimized automatically through a conversion script that creates WebP versions at different sizes.</p><p>I also added skeleton loaders to improve how fast things feel while content loads, and spent time optimizing for Core Web Vitals, particularly trying to improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and First Contentful Paint (FCP) times[^3].</p><p>Font loading can make sites feel sluggish. Instead of linking to Google Fonts, I went with self-hosted Inter fonts[^4] that I subsetted to just the characters I actually need. This cuts the font file size significantly, which is especially important for mobile users or anyone on limited data plans.</p><p>I kept the JavaScript minimal but added some touches that improve the overall feel. Simple page transitions, dark mode that follows system preferences, skeleton loaders for better perceived performance, responsive design that works well on everything from phones to large monitors, and basic loading states so things don&#39;t feel broken.</p><p>The build process handles the standard SEO components automatically. It generates sitemaps, creates Open Graph tags for social sharing, adds basic structured data, optimizes images with proper alt tags, and creates RSS feeds.</p><p>I worked to get good Lighthouse[^5] scores and solid mobile performance, covering the basics that search engines care about.</p><h2 id="why-this-approach-works-for-saas-ideas">Why This Approach Works for SaaS Ideas</h2><p>This setup is also useful for testing out SaaS ideas, though there are some considerations about building more complex applications.</p><p>Cloudflare offers D1 (their managed, serverless database with SQLite&#39;s SQL semantics)[^1] [^8] and Workers KV for data storage, which is suitable for many projects but something to keep in mind. Workers KV is designed for high-read, low-write scenarios with global distribution[^2].</p><p>Starting free means no infrastructure costs while you figure out if your idea has potential. Cloudflare&#39;s paid tiers are reasonable ($5/month for 10 million requests according to their pricing page). Edge computing knowledge transfers to other projects, and your app works well everywhere from day one.</p><p>You might need to migrate if you need complex database operations or more than 10GB of data, if you require specific Node.js packages that aren&#39;t compatible with the Workers runtime, if you hit performance limitations that can&#39;t be worked around, or if you need more than the CPU time limits per request.</p><p>If you&#39;re consistently hitting 100,000+ requests per day, you&#39;re probably ready to think about monetization anyway, and by then you&#39;ll have a better sense of whether the platform constraints work for your specific use case.</p><h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><p>What started as wanting to avoid monthly hosting bills turned into a good learning experience about modern web deployment. Working within free service constraints led to solutions that were both cost-effective and surprisingly performant.</p><p>This approach works well for personal portfolios and project showcases, simple blogs and content sites, landing pages for side projects, testing ideas before committing to paid infrastructure, and learning about edge computing and modern deployment.</p><p>The code is open source if you want to use it. Clone it, customize it, add your content, and you could have a portfolio running this afternoon.</p><p>Sometimes working within constraints leads to simpler, more maintainable solutions than just throwing money at the problem.</p><hr><p><em>Questions or want to share how you adapted this? I&#39;d love to hear about it. The code is on GitHub if you want to take a look.</em></p><hr><h1 id="complete-setup-guide">Complete Setup Guide</h1><p>Ready to build your own?
