        Hi, I'm Cole Cianflone, a passionate Software Developer with experience in
        full-stack development, cloud technologies, and DevOps practices. I
        enjoy building scalable, maintainable applications and am always eager to

        I have a strong background in C#, VB.NET, .NET, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and
        Python, and I’m experienced with AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. My
        professional journey includes working on diverse projects, collaborating
